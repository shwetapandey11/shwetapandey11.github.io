    				A pool might not be the first place you think of going when you're  looking to shape up and slim down—but perhaps it shoulPLod be. No other  workout burns calories, boosts metabolism, and firms every muscle in  your body (without putting stress on your joints) better than a swimming workout.
    				<br />
     				<br />
					Look no further than superstar Natalie Coughlin to observe how water can whittle a sexy, sculpted silhouette &amp; you  don't have to be an Olympic gold medalist to get the perfect body. When  researchers at the  Indiana University compared re - creational fitness swimmers  with non-swimmers, they found that swimmers of all ages had more lean  muscle &amp; trimmer waists and hips.<br />
 					<br />
    				And while swimming may not offer the lace - up - your- shoes - &amp; - go  convenience of running, all you need are three key items—swimsuit, cap,  and goggles—and you're set to hit the water. So go ahead: Make a splash  with one of the best workouts for everyone.

			    <p>
			    	Eating the right things at the right time is important to help you swim  well. If you&rsquo;re using swimming as a way to lose or maintain your weight  or want to improve performance, start eating right.
			    </p>
			    <ul>
			      <li>Try to pick as wide a range of colors as possible. This will ensure a wider range of nutrients and antioxidants.</li>
			      <li>Green is ALWAYS a winner!Red is also good as they tend to be very high in antioxidants</li>
			      <li>Carbs are important, just try to get the brown version of rice, bread, and sugar, to stay on the safe side.</li>
			      <li>Chicken, turkey, lean mince and fish. Eat about 30–40 grams a meal, that's about the size of your han<br />
			        Fish such as cod, plaice, haddock, bass etc<br />
			        Oily fish such as tuna, mackerel, salmon, sardines, and trout</li>
